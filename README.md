- 👋 Hi, I’m @isharambhal! A geology enthusiast diving headfirst into the exciting world of GIS, data science, machine learning, and AI.

- 👀 I’m interested in unraveling the mysteries of our planet through geospatial data analysis, predictive modeling, and uncovering hidden patterns within geological datasets.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ins and outs of:

GIS: Mastering ArcGIS and QGIS to manipulate spatial data and uncover geological insights.

Data Science & Analytics: Expanding my expertise in Python with libraries like NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation, and SQL for efficient database querying.

ML/AI: Venturing into the world of machine learning with TensorFlow to develop predictive models for geological events and enhance my understanding of AI algorithms.

Data Visualization: Exploring techniques to visually represent complex geological and geographical data for effective communication and analysis.


- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects merging GIS, data science, and ML/AI to unravel geological phenomena and contribute to innovative solutions in the field.
